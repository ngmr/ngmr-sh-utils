This repository holds some useful utility scripts.

Directories of note include:
- `bin/` holds the utility scripts.
- `bash-completion/completions/` holds associated bash tab completion scripts.

See [the bash-completion FAQ](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/blob/main/README.md#faq) for details on where to place bash completions scripts locally so that they are picked up automagically.
